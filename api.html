Wikipedia</a>, the free encyclopedia, provides this definition for APIs.

<span class="w3-serif w3-xlarge"><br>
	In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for
	building application software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods of communication between various software 
	components.

In the App Inventor world, APIs are often used with the Web component to connect to other services. The Web component supports the methods 
HTTP GET, HTTP PUT and HTTP DELETE. The most common use is to delegate jobs to another service, because your phone is not capable of
performing a task. You can also use more complicated services such as Weather Underground (forecasts) and Wolfram|Alpha (AI).
