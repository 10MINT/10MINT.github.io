<h1>All About Storage</h1>
<h4>(At least I hope it's all)</h4><hr>
<ul>
	<li>All rules should apply to all App Inventor platforms</li>
	<li>All built-in procedures will overwrite folders and files if they already exist</li>
	<li>A <code>/</code> (forward slash) before the actual file name accesses the sdcard, <code>//</code> (two slashes) access the 
                app's asset	folder, if the file starts without a slash, you access the apps data folder</li>
	<li>The companion is a special case where the files are written to the sd card (for easier debugging). The file path is <code>
                /AppInventor/assets/</code> for assets and <code>/AppInventor/data/</code> for the data folder</li>
	<li>You can access files with the absolute filepath (starting with <code>file:///</code>)</li>
	<li>There are also other ways to access specific folders of the phone, e.g. <code>content://media/external/images/media</code> accesses 
                the images in the gallery</li>
	<li>A link to a file on the internet is also a valid address</li>
	<li>It is currently not possible to store files in the app's asset folder</li>
	<li>To display files in the WebViewer, you have to set the URL to the URI of the file</li>
	<li>The asset folder has an URI called <code>file:///android_asset/</code></li>
	<li>The data folder should have the URI <code>file:///data/user/0/{packagename}/files/</code>. It might not be the same for everyone,
                we'll have to do some research</li>
	<li>It is possible to create folders. <code>/new_folder/filename</code> will create the folder <code>new_folder</code> on the sd card 
                and will put the file <code>filename</code> in it. Though, I'm not able to reproduce that</li>
	<li>If the folder starts with a . (dot), the folder will be hidden, i.e. invisible for non-root users</li>
	<li>You can also set the url of the WebViewer to <code>data:text/html,{html formatted text}</code> to load the content of a html 
                file into the webviewer. This is especially useful in combination with the <code>ReadFrom file</code> block</li>
</ul>
<h2>The solution (deprecated)</h2>
<div class="w3-panel w3-pale-green w3-border w3-border-green" id="solution">
	<p>I finally found a way to make this possible. Assuming
	<ol>
		<li>you want to read/write files and you want to display them in the webviewer,</li>
		<li>you don't want to store data on the sd card, because every phone treats external storage differently and you don't want your files be accessible 
		from the outside</li>
		<li>and there is no URI for the data folder of the app,</li>
	</ol>    
	there is only one way to do it:
	<ol>
		<li>Read the content of the file</li>
		<li>Set the WebViewer.Url to join "data:text/html," "[content of the file]"</li>
		<li>Append something by appending it to the file while setting WebViewer.Url to join get WebViewer.current Url "new content" (The File.Got Text 
		event provides the text)</li>
		<li>Adding css style is only possible by adding <code>style</code> tags between data:text/html, and the actual content</li>
	</ol>	
	I think it could also b possible with JavaScript in the document, but this is very inconvenient.</p>
